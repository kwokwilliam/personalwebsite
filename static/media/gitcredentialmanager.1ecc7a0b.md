# Git Credential Manager

If you're on Windows, you may find yourself entering your login information every time you push to github. This is fixed by installing [Git credential manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) (scroll down and look for the latest installer link). Now you should be able to enter you information once when you push and it'll work automatically from now on.
