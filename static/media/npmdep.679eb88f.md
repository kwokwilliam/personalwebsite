# Installing NPM Dependencies

Remember that whenever you download or clone a new repository, you *must* do `npm install` before running jest tests! You will especially need to do this for javascript development later on. You can read _why_ over here: https://info340.github.io/machine-setup.html#node-and-npm under 'package.json'.

> Notice that there are two packages listed under "dependencies": lodash and moment (the ^4.17.4 indicates which version of lodash). You can use npm to automatically install all of the packages listed under "dependencies" (as well as under "devDependencies") using the command:
> `npm install`
> Thus using npm install without any arguments means “install all of the requirements that have been listed for this project”. This is a good first step any time you download a project or checkout a repository from GitHub
