# Fixing Merge Conflicts

Step 1. Don't panic. Merge conflicts happen and are inevitable. They don't necessarily mean you did anything wrong. In the error message, you should be able to see what files are affected by the conflict. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you may also see the file name turn red in the sidebar indicating this.

Step 2. I can't explain it better than this resource. Follow the steps here to remove the merge conflicts: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/

In addition, Visual Studio Code makes solving this merge conflict a lot nicer on your eyes because it highlights newer/older code and has buttons for fixing the conflicts.
