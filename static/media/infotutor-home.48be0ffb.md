# Informatics Tutor Hub

Welcome to the Informatics tutor page. Here you will find helpful links to information that should help you throughout your journey in Informatics. I wish I could find time to help every single student, but unfortunately that just isn't possible. I have created a repository of useful tidbits that you will want to take a look at if you ever want to remember how to do something. These tidbits will be updated over time as I see more of what people are struggling with. I have recorded videos for some of them. Scroll to the bottom for office hours.

> Note: Data is being collected on visit counts. This is so I get a better understanding of what people need help with most. This data is completely anonymous and I will have virtually no way of knowing who is linked to what internal ID. [See how I set your randomized ID](https://github.com/kwokwilliam/personalwebsite/blob/master/src/index.js). The [Tutor Queue](/tutorq) page is _temporarily_ not anonymous while you are in queue, and will make this current data that is being collected identifiable. Non-anonymized data will never be shared, only raw numbers.

This page will be iterated as the quarter goes on. You may have to hard reload to get new pages listed!
