# Recommended Browser

I highly suggest either using Firefox or Google Chrome as your browser for Client Side Development. While all browsers nowadays are conforming to web standards, Chrome and Firefox have been the two to adopt these standards the fastest. 

Later on when you make applications that are mission critical, it would be important to test your code in all major browsers, like Safari or Edge as well. 

I don't recommend Safari for this course because I have had experiences with having SVGs appear wrong. You will be using SVGs for your assignments. 

Along with that, I don't know if there are React developer tools for Safari. There are for Firefox and Chrome.

## To support or not support IE 11?

I hold the personal preference that internet explorer 11 should not be supported by any website anymore. For large companies like Amazon or Facebook, it might be very important to. If it's for your personal website or something, then maybe not. As long as you know _how_ you might support an older browser like this, that is all that is important.
