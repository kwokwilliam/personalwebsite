# Tagging Commits

In Client Side Development, we may have you tag commits for your projects. This is used so we can have a reference to a specific commit. You can tag the **last commit** by running the following command. 

```bash
git tag tagname
```

You can check that this worked by running just `git tag`

then push that commit by doing this command: 

```bash
git push --tags
```
