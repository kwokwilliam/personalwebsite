# Informatics Tutor Hub

Welcome to my tutor page. Here you will find helpful links to information that should help you throughout your journey in Informatics. I wish I could find time to help every single student, but unfortunately that just isn't possible. I have created a repository of useful tidbits that you will want to take a look at if you ever want to remember how to do something. These tidbits will be updated over time as I see more of what people are struggling with. I have recorded videos for some of them. Scroll to the bottom for office hours.

This page is still under construction.
