                I learned in the classroom to use, and incorporate some data analysis to better the 
                community I used to be a part of.\n
                A day before the competition, I slapped together a scouting app that would be internal
                to my old team. They collected data that would later be input to the app. This app 
                allowed them to use live updating data during their alliance selection to pick the best,
                most compatible team.\n
                After the competition, the data was released to the Hawaii Robotics community so teams 
                could better understand their performance going into the world championship. \n
                The application was programmed using NodeJS, JavaScript, and the React Framework..`,
