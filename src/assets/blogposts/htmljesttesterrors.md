# HTML Jest Test Errors

If you are running the HTML jest test, you will see that if it fails, it will provide error messages and the lines associated with them. Study them and try to find what is wrong. Below, I have listed some common problems that may cause errors that don't entirely tell you what is wrong:

1. Single quotation marks in HTML attributes
2. Missing closing/opening bracket
3. Missing closing tag
4. Escape character not used correctly

Please see the Info tutor hub for more problems that may arise.
