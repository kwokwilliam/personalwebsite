# Informatics Tutor Hub

Welcome to my tutor page. Here you will find helpful links to information that should help you throughout your journey in Informatics. I wish I could find time to help every single student, but unfortunately that just isn't possible. I have created a repository of useful tidbits that you will want to take a look at.
