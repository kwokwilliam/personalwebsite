# Using console log

If you're confused on why something might not be working, returning undefined, or getting an error that something doesn't exist, be sure to `console.log` all the variables that might be having that issue! You also may run across some things where using `typeof` will help too! Learning some of the things that can go wrong will help for later because often times the same problem patterns emerge.
