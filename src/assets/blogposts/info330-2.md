# SQL Database Start to Finish

## Introduction

In this module, we will see how to go from a database spec to a final product with a simple example involving student information, course information, and enrollment information. There will be code snippets along the way to give short examples of the process. This process involves creating the database and tables, creating the constraints, creating views and a reporting view, creating stored procedures for the tables, setting permissions, and writing code to test the code we just made.

It is often the case where more than one person is deciding what the database structures should look like, so you won’t be alone in creating a Metadata worksheet. Let us assume one has been provided for us, and that you understand Entity Relationship Diagrams.

## Creating the Database and Tables with Constraints

First, you want to create a simple database and have some statements that drop the database if it exists, for testing purposes. Next, you just want to create your tables with the constraints specified in the Metadata worksheet.

```sql
create table dbo.Students (
    StudentID int identity(1,1) not null primary key,
    StudentNumber nvarchar(100) not null unique,
    StudentFirstName nvarchar(100) not null,
    StudentLastName nvarchar(100) not null,
    StudentEmail nvarchar(100) not null unique,
    StudentPhone nvarchar(100) check (
      StudentPhone like '[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'),
    StudentAddress1 nvarchar(100) not null,
    StudentAddress2 nvarchar(100),
    StudentCity nvarchar(100) not null,
    StudentStateCode nvarchar(100) not null,
    StudentZipCode nvarchar(100) not null check (
      StudentZipCode like '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]' or
      StudentZipCode like '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]')
)
```

Personally, what I do is I organize my code by my process of actions, rather than by the subject. What this means is that instead of organizing all my code by Students, Courses, and Enrollments, I organize it by setting up tables, views, procedures, and tests. This can be done any way you prefer. The only point of separation of concerns here is to organize the code in some way. 

Some constraints may require accessing another table. In our case, we want to make sure the date the student enrolled in the course is before the date the course was planned to start. This would be done using a check constraint, but a function must be used, since inline select statements will not work with check constraints. 

```sql
-- Create function to grab the start date to later use for Enrollments table constraint
create function dbo.EnrollmentDateTimeValid (@CourseID int)
returns date
as
    begin
        return(select CourseStartDate from dbo.Courses where CourseID = @CourseID)
    end
go

-- Enrollments table
create table dbo.Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID int identity(1,1) not null primary key,
    StudentID int not null foreign key references dbo.Students(StudentID),
    CourseID int not null foreign key references dbo.Courses(CourseID),
    EnrollmentDateTime datetime not null default getdate(),
    EnrollmentPrice money not null,
    constraint CK_EnrollmentDateTimeValid check (EnrollmentDateTime < dbo.EnrollmentDateTimeValid(CourseID))
)
```

## Creating Views and a Reporting View

Next, we want to create views and a reporting view that combines all the data into a view. It is important to make sure that individuals only access a view when they want to read data from a table, rather than viewing from the table itself. This is called an abstraction layer and provides the database with more security. It also allows the database’s underlying table structure to be changed without ruining any front-end applications that relied specifically on the column names of the tables.

```sql
-- Enrollment view
create view dbo.vEnrollments
as
    select * from dbo.Enrollments
```
> Figure 4: An example of creating a view from a table

## Creating Stored Procedures

Like how views are an abstraction layer for reading data from a table, stored procedures are an abstraction layer for creating, updating, and deleting data from a table. They can also provide some security and error handling that is abstracted away from those using the procedures. We want to create stored procedures next, as they are just as important to have as views in a professional database.

```sql
-- Delete enrollment
create proc pDelEnrollments (
    @EnrollmentID int
)
/* Author: WKwok
** Desc: Delete enrollment
** Change Log: When,Who,What
** <2018-11-11>,WKwok,Created stored procedure.
*/
as
 begin
  declare @RC int = 0;
  begin try
   begin tran 
    delete from dbo.Enrollments 
    where EnrollmentID = @EnrollmentID
   commit tran
   set @RC = +1
  end Try
  begin catch
   if(@@trancount > 0) rollback tran
   print error_message()
   set @RC = -1
  end catch
  return @RC;
 end
```

## Setting Permissions

It is imperative to have permissions set on the database, otherwise people will be able to update and delete anything they want to. In our case, we will just be giving access to the public, but this varies from case to case. You may want to deny access to delete data from certain user groups.

```sql
-- Deny everything to public, so no access to the tables directly
deny select, insert, update, delete on dbo.Students to public
go

deny select, insert, update, delete on dbo.Courses to public
go

deny select, insert, update, delete on dbo.Enrollments to public
go
```
> Figure 6: An example of denying access to the tables directly from the public user group

## Writing Test Code

Writing test code to make sure all your tables, views, and procedures work is very important. You may want to write some brief test code after making your tables to make sure the constraints on them work. In our case, we will just be testing if the stored procedures work and return data as expected. 

```sql
declare @status int;
exec @status = pInsStudents 
    @StudentNumber = 'abc',
    @StudentFirstName = 'William', 
    @StudentLastName = 'Kwok', 
    @StudentEmail = 'wkwok16@uw.edu', 
    @StudentPhone = '555-555-5555', 
    @StudentAddress1 = '123 Address Street', 
    @StudentAddress2 = 'Apt 2002', 
    @StudentCity = 'Seattle', 
    @StudentStateCode = 'WA', 
    @StudentZipCode = '98105';
select [pInsStudents status] = @status;
go
```

## Input Data

Finally, once all the above has been completed, you can insert some initial data that you have been tasked with inserting. This step is optional, because you may not want to insert data into your tables yet. In our case, even though we have access to the underlying table, we want to use the stored procedures for an extra layer of assurance.

```sql
exec pInsCourses 
    @CourseName = 'SQL1',
    @CourseStartDate = '01-10-2017',
    @CourseEndDate = '01-24-2017',
    @CourseStartTime = '18:00',
    @CourseEndTime = '20:50',
    @CourseCurrentPrice = '$399'
go
```

## Summary

We have now gone through the entire process of creating a database that can be used in production. We only lightly touched on the things that should be done in a database from creating the tables with constraints, views, stored procedures, tests, and permissions. Ideally, you would have a lot of teammates checking your work along the way to make sure things are done with the utmost care and security, because an entire business could rely on this code working.
